# Mind Trace

## What is Mind Trace?
Mind Trace is mood-tracking application to facilitate user self-reflection on their online behaviours and help them develop skills to engage positively online. Since TikTok has grown its popularity among young people, it has been chosen to be the main social media platform to utilise in this project.
